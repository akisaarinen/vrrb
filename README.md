vrrb - show local train timetables in a nice format

vrrb is a simple sinatra web application which shows real-time timetables for
local trains in Helsinki area from vr.fi, formatted a little bit more nicely
for Your Station(TM).

You can configure the application for your station and it will show all
available real-time timetable information from vr.fi in one view, so you can
check when does the next train leave and if it seems to be delayed.
